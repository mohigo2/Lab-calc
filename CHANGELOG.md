### Technical Implementation
- **Architecture**
  - TypeScript-based plugin with modular design
  - Separation of concerns: calculation engine, UI components, data management
  - Extensible type system for future enhancements
  - Memory-efficient state management

- **Calculation Engine**
  - Precise C1V1=C2V2 calculations with unit conversion
  - Support for molar, mass-based, and percentage concentrations
  - Error propagation and validation throughout calculation chain
  - Optimized display unit selection algorithm

- **Code Quality**

### Known Issues
- Stock solution calculator UI pending implementation (placeholder shown)
- Serial dilution calculator UI pending implementation (placeholder shown)
- Advanced recipe management features planned for future releases

### Breaking Changes
- None (initial release)

### Migration Guide
- Not applicable (initial release)

### Performance Improvements
- Optimized reagent search with debounced input
- Efficient DOM updates for real-time calculations
- Lazy loading of reagent database
- Minimal bundle size with tree shaking

### Security Considerations
- All user data stored locally in Obsidian vault
- No external data transmission for calculations
- External links use secure HTTPS connections
- Input sanitization for security

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatible labels
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management for modal dialogs

### Browser/Platform Support
- Obsidian Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Obsidian Mobile (iOS, Android) - basic functionality
